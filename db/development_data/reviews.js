        review: 'Nice part of the country to stay in. I had such an amazing time here walking around the countryside, breathing all that fresh air, seeing all the birds and animals. You know this reminds me of a time when I was sitting in a park talking to my friend, Orville. Orville,  I said, isnt this a great place to be. But of course Orville couldnt respond as he is an elephant, and elephants cant speak English. But thats not important right now to the story. Because you see sometimes a story is just a story and we shouldnt dwell on these things. Anyway, Orville and I discussed the countryside and had a great time feeding the ducks that day.',
